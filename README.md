# Pennsylvania Nursing Homes
The Jupyter Notebook (get_PA_nursing_home_data.ipnb) scrapes data from the (*Pennsylvania Department of Health's Nursing Care Facility Locator Page*)[https://sais.health.pa.gov/commonpoc/nhLocatorie.asp], for Montgomery County, PA.

The data are then written out to the `output` directory, as *.csv (comma separated values) file.
