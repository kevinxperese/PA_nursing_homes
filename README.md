# Pennsylvania Nursing Homes
The Jupyter Notebook in this repo (`get_PA_nursing_home_data.ipynb`) scrapes data from the [*Pennsylvania Department of Health's Nursing Care Facility Locator Page*](https://sais.health.pa.gov/commonpoc/nhLocatorie.asp), for Montgomery County, PA.

The data are filtered to select only facilities that accept Medicaid as a payment option, then cleaned up a little to present contact info in an easy=to-read format, and then written out to the `output` directory, as *.csv (comma separated values) file.
